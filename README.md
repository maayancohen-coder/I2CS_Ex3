# Pac-Man Game – Custom Server & Client (Ex3)

This project is a complete implementation of a Pac-Man game, developed as part of Exercise 3.
It includes a custom-built game server, a graphical client implemented with StdDraw,
a smart Pac-Man algorithm, and a comprehensive test suite.

The project was designed with a clear separation between server-side logic and client-side rendering,
while remaining compatible with the course engine interfaces.
